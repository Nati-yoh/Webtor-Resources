        <p>CSS, or <strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong>, is a language developed to separate the structure (HTML) from the presentation of web content, allowing developers to control layout, colors, fonts, and spacing without cluttering the HTML with styling details. The term &quot;cascading&quot; signifies the layering of styles, where rules can apply from multiple sources and &quot;cascade&quot; in priority based on specificity and order. This cascading nature gives CSS flexibility, allowing global and targeted styles on a page.</p>
        <h3>The History of CSS</h3>
        <p>CSS was born out of necessity in the mid-1990s. In the early days of the web, HTML handled both content structure and presentation, but this made web development cumbersome and created inconsistencies. As more people accessed the web, there was a need for standardized styling across browsers.</p>
        <ol>
        <li>
        <p><strong>Early Days (1994)</strong>: Håkon Wium Lie, a Norwegian web pioneer, proposed CSS in 1994 while working at CERN (where the web was invented). His goal was to simplify and standardize web styling.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><strong>CSS1 (1996)</strong>: The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) released CSS1, a basic version with properties for fonts, colors, text alignment, and spacing. However, CSS1 was limited and only partially supported by browsers, leading to compatibility issues.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><strong>CSS2 (1998)</strong>: CSS2 introduced more advanced layout options like absolute and relative positioning, as well as media types for responsive design (e.g., print vs. screen). Despite these improvements, inconsistent browser support still posed challenges.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><strong>CSS3 (2000s)</strong>: CSS3, introduced in modules, revolutionized web design by adding features like animations, gradients, transitions, and responsive design (using media queries). This marked a shift, as CSS3 allowed more complex, visually engaging, and dynamic web pages.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><strong>Modern CSS (2010s to Present)</strong>: Now, CSS continues to evolve with features like grid layouts, flexbox, and custom properties (CSS variables), making it easier to create responsive, accessible, and complex layouts. CSS has become essential for creating modern web applications that look good across all devices.</p>
        </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>CSS’s Deeper Meaning</h3>
        <p>CSS embodies the principle of <strong>separation of concerns</strong> in web design, meaning content and structure (HTML) are kept separate from design (CSS). This separation enhances maintainability, makes it easier to update and scale a website, and allows designers and developers to work more effectively together.</p>
